                    Hi! I'm <a href="http://javierivero.com">Javier</a> and I'd love to lead and build Lovable's Community<br><br>
                    First and foremost I'm someone who is very passionate about tech. I've worked at Uber for 6 years where I helped scale the community support operation across Latin America. After that I most recently joined Stripe where I lead the global support operations for Link (yes, the same checkout system Lovable currently uses).
                    <br><br>Most recently I started creating my own apps using tools like Cursor, v0 and most recently Lovable. I truly believe in the power of community to help drive adoption of these tools as I've seen it work first hand in both Uber & Stripe.
